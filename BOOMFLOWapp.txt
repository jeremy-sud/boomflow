Suggested Name: Boomflow
Tagline: Where talent isn't managed — it's cultivated.

1. The Humanist Concept
Instead of measuring "productivity" (how many hours you sit at a desk), the app measures flow and purpose. It's about creating an ecosystem where a colleague isn't just a number, but an individual with goals, fears, and hidden talents.

2. "Generous" and Empathetic Features
Peer-to-Peer Recognition (Micro-Kudos):
A space where any colleague can send a "Kudo" (a public or private thank-you) for specific help. These points aren't necessarily redeemed for money, but rather for "time for personal projects" or training.

Mood Check-in (Safe Space):
Every morning, the app asks: "How's your energy today?" If an employee marks low levels several days in a row, the app alerts the manager — not to reprimand, but to suggest: "Hey, this person might need a day off or help with their current workload."

Cross-functional Internal Mentorship:
An algorithm that connects someone who wants to learn Python with someone on the technical team who wants to improve their leadership. It fosters community instead of hierarchy.

The "Failure Resume" and Learnings:
A section where leaders share their mistakes and what they learned, normalizing error and reducing workplace anxiety.

3. Business Model (Future Considerations)
To generate revenue without betraying its essence, these strategies could potentially be explored in the future (none are currently active):

Internal Use for Retention: A happy employee is 30% more productive and losing talent costs thousands in new hires. Boomflow is currently used internally by Sistemas Ursol to address this.

Wellness Benefits Marketplace: Integrate third-party services (online therapy, yoga sessions, courses) and take a commission for each service booked through the app.

Data Insights (Anonymized): Sell aggregated reports of "blind spots" to the company. Example: "Your design team is exhausted on Thursdays — consider reducing meetings that day."

4. Architecture for Building on GitHub
Here's how the core of the project could be divided:

Backend (Empathy API): Develop an engine that processes message sentiment and manages mentorship connections.

Frontend (Human Dashboard): A clean interface with soft colors (color psychology), far from boring gray Excel tables.

Security and Privacy: This is vital. End-to-end encryption must be implemented for anonymous comments, so the user fully trusts the tool.

Pro Insight: The real money today is in solving the mental health crisis and workplace disconnection. If you build something that makes people not hate Mondays, companies will fight to buy it.

What tech stack do you and your colleague know? (For example: React/Node, Python/Django, Flutter...) That way I can give you a technical roadmap for your first Sprint.
