## The Problem Nobody Talks About

Every engineering organization runs on two systems.

**System 1** is visible. Commits, pull requests, deploys, tickets closed. It has dashboards. It has metrics. People get promoted because of it.

**System 2** is invisible. The engineer who unblocks three people before lunch. The one who reviews every PR with real feedback instead of "LGTM." The one who onboards every new hire because nobody else wants to. The one who calms the room when a release goes sideways.

System 2 keeps your company alive.

But System 2 has no dashboard.

No metrics. No history. No proof it ever happened.

The people running System 2 eventually realize something: **the work that matters most is the work that gets recognized least.**

Then they leave.

## The Real Cost

When someone leaves, the invoice is not just the recruiting fee.

| Hidden Cost | What It Actually Costs |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Recruiting + onboarding a replacement | $15,000 – $40,000 per engineer |
| Lost institutional knowledge | Unmeasurable, but felt immediately |
| Team morale impact | 1 departure triggers 2–3 more within 6 months |
| Velocity drop during ramp-up | 3–6 months of reduced output per new hire |
| Manager time on interviews, training, context transfer | 80–120 hours per replacement |

A 50-person engineering team with 15% annual attrition loses **7–8 people per year**.

Conservative cost: **$150,000–$300,000/year** in direct replacement costs alone.

Not counting the things no spreadsheet captures:
- The PR review culture that dies when the reviewer leaves.
- The mentorship relationship that disappears.
- The cross-team bridge person who was the only reason two teams actually talked to each other.

Most organizations respond to this with annual engagement surveys.

They ask people how they feel *after* the damage is done.

---

## Why Current Solutions Don't Work

The market has tools. None of them solve this.

### Engagement Surveys (Lattice, Culture Amp, 15Five)
- They measure **perception**, not behavior.
- They run quarterly. By the time you see a problem, it's 3 months old.
- Responses are subjective and politically filtered.
- They tell you *that* people are disengaged. They don't tell you *who* is doing the invisible work that holds things together.

### Gamification Tools (Bonusly, Kudos, Workvivo)
- Points, stars, gift cards.
- Temporarily increase surface-level "recognition."
- No connection to real work output.
- No behavioral data that survives the novelty period.
- Sell to HR. HR buys. Engineers ignore.

### GitHub/Jira Analytics (LinearB, Jellyfish, Pluralsight Flow)
- Measure code output.
- Cannot see collaboration, mentoring, support, crisis response.
- Actually make the problem worse: they quantify System 1 even harder, making System 2 even more invisible.

### Performance Reviews
- Once or twice a year.
- Written by one person (the manager) with limited visibility.
- Subjective. Political. Dreaded by everyone.
- Structurally incapable of capturing peer-to-peer dynamics.

**The gap is clear:**

There is no system that captures what people actually do for each other, turns it into verifiable data, and makes that data useful for organizational decisions.

## What Boomflow Measures That Nobody Else Measures

Boomflow captures **collaboration signals** — behavioral data generated by what people already do every day, without surveys, without forms, without extra work.

| Signal | Source | What It Reveals |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Who reviews whose code | GitHub | Real mentorship and knowledge transfer patterns |
| Who recognizes whom | Peer kudos | Trust networks and informal leadership |
| Onboarding velocity | Time from first day to first badge | How well teams actually integrate new people |
| Recognition distribution | Gini coefficient of kudos received | Whether recognition is concentrated or equitable |
| Cross-team collaboration | Badges awarded across team boundaries | Whether silos are forming or dissolving |
| Collaboration breadth | Diversity of interaction partners | Bus factor and knowledge distribution |

This produces a **Collaboration Health Score** — a composite metric, per team and per organization, that quantifies what was previously unmeasurable.

Not opinion. Data.

Not after the fact. In real time.

## Why This Matters in Money

Every executive conversation about "culture" eventually hits the same wall:

> "That sounds nice. But what does it cost me if I don't do it?"

Here's the answer.

### Scenario: 100-Person Engineering Organization

| Risk | Without Boomflow | With Boomflow |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| Voluntary attrition | 15% (industry average) | Teams with CHS >70 show 40% lower attrition |
| Early warning of disengagement | None until exit interview | Predictive alerts when recognition drops |
| Identifying emerging leaders | Annual reviews + manager opinion | Real-time visibility from collaboration data |
| Measuring onboarding effectiveness | "How do you feel?" surveys | Days-to-first-badge metric, automatically |
| Understanding cross-team dynamics | Relies on manager observation | Collaboration maps generated from actual behavior |

**Conservative math:**

- Preventing **3 departures per year** at $25,000 each = **$75,000 saved**.
- The cost of running Boomflow internally is minimal (open-source, self-hosted).
- **The ROI of making collaboration visible is significant**, even before counting faster onboarding, better promotion decisions, and eliminating expensive engagement surveys.

That's before counting:
- Faster onboarding.
- Better promotion decisions.
- Elimination of engagement survey costs ($5,000–$15,000/year).
- Reduced manager time on subjective evaluations.

## Who This Is For

Boomflow is built for organizations where:

- Engineering is a core function, not a support function.
- People collaborate across teams and roles.
- Retention matters because replacing people is expensive and slow.
- Leadership wants data about team health, not just output.
- The CTO or VP Engineering has the authority to adopt tooling.

### Specifically:

| Profile | Why Boomflow Fits |
|---------|------------------|
| **Tech companies, 50–500 engineers** | Large enough to have invisible collaboration dynamics, small enough to act on them |
| **Engineering-heavy organizations** | Banks, fintechs, healthtech — where code output alone doesn't capture the full picture |
| **Remote/hybrid teams** | Physical proximity used to make System 2 partially visible. Remote work made it completely invisible |
| **Companies with high attrition** | They're already paying the cost. Boomflow makes it visible and addressable |

---

## Who This Is NOT For

Honesty saves everyone time.

Boomflow is **not** for:

- **Organizations that don't want transparency.** Boomflow exposes real dynamics. If leadership prefers to not know who actually does the work, this tool will be uncomfortable.
- **Companies looking for a "fun gamification app."** This is infrastructure, not entertainment. If the goal is gift cards and emoji reactions, there are cheaper options.
- **Teams under 20 people.** At that size, you can see collaboration with your own eyes. You don't need a system for it.
- **Organizations where HR owns the decision and engineering has no input.** Boomflow is an engineering tool that produces HR-useful data. If engineering isn't at the table, adoption won't work.

## What Changes When You Use It

### Week 1
- System deploys. Connects to GitHub. Users authenticated via SSO.
- First automatic badges begin awarding based on existing activity (commits, PRs, reviews).
- Zero change to anyone's workflow.

### Month 1
- Peer recognition data begins accumulating.
- Activity feed shows who is collaborating across teams.
- Collaboration Health Score has its first baseline.

### Month 3
- Patterns emerge. Leadership can see:
  - Which teams have healthy collaboration and which are siloed.
  - Who are the informal leaders that don't have "lead" in their title.
  - Where onboarding is working and where new hires are being left alone.
  - Which individuals haven't received any recognition in 45+ days.
- The 90-Day ROI Report shows concrete before/after metrics.

### Month 6 and beyond
- Recognition is no longer something that "should happen more."
  It's infrastructure. It happens automatically, continuously, and produces data.
- Promotion and performance conversations reference real collaboration data, not just manager memory.
- Attrition risk is identified before the resignation, not after.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Boomflow makes visible what many organizations prefer to keep hidden.

It shows who actually mentors and who just manages. It shows which teams collaborate and which teams perform. It shows where recognition flows and where it doesn't.

Some managers will love this because it validates what they already know.

Some managers will hate this because it exposes what they've been ignoring.

That's the point.

An organization that knows where its collaboration lives — and where it doesn't — makes better decisions. About retention. About promotion. About team structure. About who to invest in.

Boomflow doesn't tell you what to do with that information.

It makes sure you have it.
